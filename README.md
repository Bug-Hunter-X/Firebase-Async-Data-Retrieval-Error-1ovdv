# Firebase Async Data Retrieval Error
This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error when working with Firebase Realtime Database asynchronous operations. The bug arises from attempting to access data before the asynchronous data retrieval operation completes.  The solution provided uses Promises to handle the asynchronous nature of the data retrieval and ensures data availability before accessing it.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs because Firebase data retrieval is asynchronous.  Directly accessing data after initiating a query may lead to null values or undefined behavior if the data hasn't loaded yet.

## Solution
The solution uses JavaScript Promises to ensure that the data is loaded before it is accessed. This prevents the error by ensuring the asynchronous operation is complete before accessing the data.
