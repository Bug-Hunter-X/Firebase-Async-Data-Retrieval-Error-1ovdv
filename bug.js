The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations.  The issue arises when attempting to access data from a Firebase Realtime Database query before the data has fully loaded. This often manifests as unexpected null values or undefined behavior. 
```javascript
// Incorrect approach
firebase.database().ref('users').orderByChild('score').once('value', function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.val().users[0].name); // Error prone: Data might not be loaded
});
```
